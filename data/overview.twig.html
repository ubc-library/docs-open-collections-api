    <h3>Where To Go</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you haven't used an API before, head on over to <a href="{{base_url}}/docs#api-basics">API Basics</a>.  Which will get you started on accessing our data.</li>
        <li>If you have already used APIs and you just want to know how to get at our data, skip the basics and head straight on over to our <a href="{{base_url}}/docs#api-requests">requests page</a>. (You'll need an <a href="{{base_url}}/docs#api-keys">API key</a> first.)</li>
        <li>Once you've made a request, you might need some help making sense of what it all means.  In <a href="{{base_url}}/docs#api-responses">responses</a>, we explore the structure of objects and the fields within those objects that the API returns.</li>
        <li>Now you should be ready to start building something with our API, however you might like to know the small print, so go check out our API's policies.</li>
        <li>Visit and read our <a href="{{base_url}}/terms_of_use" target="_self">terms of use page</a>, before using the API.</li>
        <li>Reach us at <a href="mailto:library.opencollections@ubc.ca" title="Open Collections Email">library.opencollections@ubc.ca</a> for inquiries.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="overview-essentials">The Essentials</h3>
    <p>If you need to start straight away, here is how:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="{{data.api_url}}" target="_blank">{{data.api_url}}</a> is the base URL of the Open Collections API.</li>
        <li>In order to pass requests to the API, you'll need to <a href="{{base_url}}/docs#register-api-key" link-out>register an API key</a> first. You also need to append &api_key=:YOUR_API_KEY (where :YOUR_API_KEY is the API key you received after registering for the Open Collections API) to any requests you make.</li>
        <li>All records are returned by default as JSON-LD objects however you can request other formats by using <a href="{{base_url}}/docs#reference-headers" link-out>request headers. </a></li>
        <li>We've got lots of <a href="{{base_url}}/docs#reference-fields">fields you can query</a>, and a whole lot of <a href="{{base_url}}/docs#api-requests">ways you can query them.</a></li>
        <li>Items and collections are the two main resource types you can request.</li>
    </ul>
